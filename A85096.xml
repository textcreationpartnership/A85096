            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>VPon the 23. of Decemb. the rebels pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared them≈øelves for battell, and their intent was to beat downe the famous ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Dublin:</hi> but fir≈øt they came to <hi>Kilmanum</hi> and burnt downe all the hou≈øes there, u≈øing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of torments to the poore prote≈øtants, but then about the ≈øpace of two dayes after Tyrone was to bring an Atmy of ten thou≈øand men to a≈ø≈øault the afore≈øaid city of Dublin, &amp; to march by <hi>Kilmanam,</hi> but the Lord <hi>Moore</hi> having intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of it, he cau≈øed the drums to beat vp, to call his ≈øouldiers together, and then related to them what the rebels intent was: wherefore he made a propo≈øition to them, which they very willingly agreed to it, that was, to undermind the ground by the way that they in ended to come, and to lay 20 barrels of Gun-powder in the ≈øame vault, the one end of it came to <hi>Kilma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:123669:3"/>and there by the policy that he u≈øed, the fire caught hold on the powder ju≈øt as they were marching over the ≈øaid place, and there at that in≈øtant were ≈ølaine and wounded of the rebels about the number of 2000, which put them in a great perplexity, and cau≈øed them to retreat backe upon the ≈øudden. Then the Earle o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>000. the Earle of Tyrone were their Generall: the Lord Moore and the Earle of Ormonds force were 6000.</p>
            <p>The Earle of Ormond bringing up his men ≈øo couragiou≈øly, that it was his hard fortune to receive a wound in the thigh with a bullet: but God be prai≈øed, he hath recovered it againe. Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rone had a great wound in the arme, but the good Lord Moore received no harme at all.</p>
            <p>In this great and victiorious battell were ≈ølain on the rebels ≈øide 4000. and of the prote≈øtants ≈øide nine hundred.</p>
            <p>Upon the 24 day of Decemb. the rebels renu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their forces, intending to a≈ø≈øault the City of <hi>Dublin,</hi> but they were beaten back by that true, valorous, and experienced Souldier Captaine Field, who hath bin in the King of Swedlands wars the≈øe 16 yeeres la≈øt pa≈øt.</p>
            <p>Then the rebels ≈øeeing that they could not gaine the afore≈øaid city, by rea≈øon they were ≈øo

            <p>Vpon the 19 day of December, the rebels ≈øent a great company of men with great ≈øtore of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes about them to the city of Dublin, under pretence of being prote≈øtants, &amp; that they were faine to flye from the County of <hi>Co<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Therefore they de≈øired, and intreated, that they might have Lodging, and they would pay for all things which they called for.</p>
            <p>Whereupon they were let in, and ≈øome Lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in one place and ≈øome in another, where they behaved them≈øelves well in an outward ≈øhew, but trechery and cruelty lodged in their bre≈øts; for they had taken an Oath before they came from the rebels to be true to them, and not to di≈øcover any of their ≈øccrets or intents, but to kill all the prote≈øtants they po≈ø≈øible could, after their time was expired.</p>
            <p>For they had ≈øo plotted together that when they were entred the City, after the ≈øpace of fourc dayes they ≈øhould kill all the prote≈øtants they po≈ø≈øible could, the houre was ≈øet downe which they ≈øhould begin at, they having great ≈øtore of pi≈øtols and bullets about them.</p>

            <p>Whereupon there was a generall ≈øearch made throughout the whole city, and took and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoned all ≈øtrangers which they found in every hou≈øe &amp; being examined before the Lord chiefe Ju≈øtices, they confe≈ø≈øed how it was, that when they were about this bloudy ma≈ø≈øacre, he rebels were to come again≈øt the city, and to batter it downe.</p>
